Subject: script/execute: Avoid crash when using "$#" outside a function scope

"$#" represents the number of arguments to a function. It is only
defined in a function scope, where "scope" is non-NULL. Currently,
if we attempt to evaluate "$#" outside a function scope, "scope" will
be NULL and we will crash with a NULL pointer dereference.

Do not attempt to count arguments for "$#" if "scope" is NULL. This
will result in "$#" being interpreted as an empty string if evaluated
outside a function scope.
