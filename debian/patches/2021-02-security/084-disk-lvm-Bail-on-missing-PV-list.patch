Subject: disk/lvm: Bail on missing PV list

There's an if block for the presence of "physical_volumes {", but if
that block is absent, then p remains NULL and a NULL-deref will result
when looking for logical volumes.

It doesn't seem like LVM makes sense without physical volumes, so error
out rather than crashing.
